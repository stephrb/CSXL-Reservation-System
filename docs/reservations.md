# Reservation of Rooms and Equipment 
## Overview
The Reservation page allows students and organizations to reserve equipment and rooms in the CSXL. This feature ensures that there is a fair system for sharing equipment in the CSXL, and it ensures that there are no overlapping reservations. 

The Reservation page has three tabs: 
* **Reserve**: See equipment and room availability on a given day, and create reservations.
* **My Reservations**: See your upcoming reservations and delete your upcoming reservaitons. 
* **Edit Reservables** (Admin Only) : Add new equipment or delete existing equipment from the CSXL.
